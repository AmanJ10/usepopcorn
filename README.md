# usePopcorn

usePopcorn is a React-based web application designed for movie enthusiasts to search for movies, view detailed information, and maintain a personalized list of watched movies. The application interacts with the OMDB API to fetch movie data and offers an interactive user experience for managing watched movies and ratings.

## Features

- **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies using the OMDB API by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **View Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie from the search results displays detailed information, including the plot, actors, director, release date, and IMDb rating.
- **Rate and Add Movies**: Users can rate movies and add them to their watched list.
- **Manage Watched Movies**: Users can view a summary of watched movies, including average IMDb ratings, user ratings, and runtime. They can also delete movies from their watched list.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
